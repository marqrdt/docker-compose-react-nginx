<h2>Lament of a 20th-century composer</h2>
<div>
    If this document is preserved in any way after I croak, it will sound like the bluster of an
    anachronistic composer/critic, the likes of Cherubini, ranting about a performance of the latest
    Beethoven string quartet heard in or around 1825.
    But I would hope a small number of people reading this know what a string quartet is, or have
    even dug their nose into one of the likes of Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, Schoenberg, Bartok,
    Shostakovich, Ligeti et al. Maybe even Cage, Feldman, Lutaslawski. The list goes on.
    But does it really?
    This page is not specifically about the genre of the String Quartet, which has a long and
    well-documented history, but more about the love of notes. No-- not the pieces of paper you passed
    behind you in chemistry class about who was ****ing who, but relations between pitch frequencies,
    which, at some . 'Notes' is an expression
