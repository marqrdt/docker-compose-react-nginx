    I've been working on making interactive sites with ReactJS and Bootstrap. ReactJS is a Javascript framework for
    making reactive and interactive websites. ReactJS was created by FaceBook and is the framework behind their page
    design and
    reactivity. FaceBook offers it to the development community as an Open Source project. One of the great advantages
    of React is
    that it abstract the often funky behavior of different browser implementations of Javascript.
    Bootstrap is a framework for creating attractive and appealing page layout and design.
    It offers a large number of intelligent defaults, but is highly flexible and customizable. I used to really hate
    dealing with Javascript when I wanted to do something midly interesting or useful on a website,
    and I'm really no expert in the language, or React for that matter.
