MMA is a simple algorithm that can be used to create pitch structures that sound like Modern Music.
This article describes the algorithm and hints at how it can be implemented in a number of modren programming languages.

The basics of MMA
MMA is a simple pitch-class selection process that imposes constraints on random selection of Pitch-classes to create an ordered 
Pitch-class Sequence of nearly any length with a satisfying level of variety that will, over time, maintain aggregate completion and can create
self-organizing Pitch-class structures. Simply put, it can create PC sequences that will, if skillfully expressed, "sound like Modern Music".

Let's dive in...
We will start with an empty sequence with no pitch-class content, expressed as an empty array [] which we will label mma_seq.

The most basic logic flow can be expressed as follows.

1. Choose a Pitch-class repetition factor pcrf as an integer from within the range of 5 through 10. We will use 6 in this example.
2. Choose the length of your desired sequence
3. Initialize mma_seq with a random Pitch-class from the range of possible Pitch-classes 0-11.

<div>
Here is a very simple implementation of MMA written in Python, using a Pitch-class repetition factor of 6:
</div>
<code>
''' Define a very simple complement function to return  all PC not in a given PC-set elements'''
def complement(elements):
    return list(filter(lambda x: x not in elements, list(range(0,12))))

''' Implement the basic MMA function in 10 lines of code '''
def mma(seq_length, pcrf):
    import collections
    used_pcs = collections.deque([])
    while len(mma_seq) < seq_length:
        pc = rand.choice(complement(used_pcs))
        mma_seq.append(pc)
        if len(used_pcs) >= pcrf:
            used_pcs.popleft()
        used_pcs.append(pc)
    return mma_seq
</code>

<div>
Example run with a desired sequence length of 24 and a Pitch-class repetition factor of 6, meaning that any 
PC in the sequence will not be in the list of 6 previous PCs:

<code>
% mma(24, 6)
% [0, 3, 11, 5, 1, 4, 10, 8, 3, 6, 7, 1, 11, 5, 4, 2, 9, 10, 1, 3, 11, 8, 0, 5]
</code>

It is interesting to note that the first 17 elements of the list above complete a 12-note aggregate.
</div>

<div>
Here's another run producing a 24 PC sequence which completes an aggregate within the first 13 PCs.
Here, I've increased the Pitch-Class Repetition Factor to 9, meaning that any PC will not be repeated within 9
PCs on either side.

<code>
    % mma(24,9)
    % [6, 2, 3, 11, 1, 10, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, 3, 6, 10, 4, 7, 5, 11, 1, 9, 8, 2]
</code>
As the PCRF variable increases, one will find an increasing number of repeated structures within the sequence. In the sequence above,
the PC Sequence [10, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2] occurs at indexes 5 and 15 (starting from 0). A PCRF value of 11 will just produce a repeating
12-note row.

Further improvements
</h2>
<div>While the basic algorithm relies on a combination of randomness and memory, it does not explicity address the Pitch-Set content
of the produced sequence. When I write music with a heavy concentration on aggregate completion ("aka Modern Music"), I have strong
preferences over the PC-Set content of the pitch world of my music. I have preferences for some PC-Set Classes over others. In the 
basic implementation of MMA illustrated above, there is no secondary PC selection process other than choosing a PC that has not appeared
in the sequence within a fixed number of elements (the variable pcrf). One possibility, which I've explored in some of my compositions
is to, at each PC selection step, choose a PC that, combined with the previous n PCs in the sequence, forms a certain PC-Set Class
of size n+1 chosen among a list of ones that I prefer. This can provide a consistent pitch universe to the music while providing a
satisfying variety to the music, along with providing steady stream of PCs for me to work into actual music. This can provide a partial
solution to the "hard problem" of music composition, which is the "What comes next?" problem.
